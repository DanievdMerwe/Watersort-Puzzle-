# Watersort-Puzzle-
This is the Java code we wrote for a project on the water puzzle game.

# <The watersort puzzle game>

In this project we did the coding for the watersort puzzle game in Java. It was a great experience to be able to learn how these type of games are coded and how everything ends up working. As well as coding the game on my own 
was a great learning curve and I am glad I could be able to complete the project. It was quite the challenge, but with enough time and trial and error I was able to successfully finish the code.
